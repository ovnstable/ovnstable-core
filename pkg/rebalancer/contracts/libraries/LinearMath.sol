    // A thorough derivation of the formulas and derivations found here exceeds the scope of this file, so only
    // introductory notions will be presented.

    // A Linear Pool holds three tokens: the main token, the wrapped token, and the Pool share token (BPT). It is
    // possible to exchange any of these tokens for any of the other two (so we have three trading pairs) in both
    // directions (the first token of each pair can be bought or sold for the second) and by specifying either the input
    // or output amount (typically referred to as 'given in' or 'given out'). A full description thus requires
    // 3*2*2 = 12 functions.
    // Wrapped tokens have a known, trusted exchange rate to main tokens. All functions here assume such a rate has
    // already been applied, meaning main and wrapped balances can be compared as they are both expressed in the same
    // units (those of main token).
    // Additionally, Linear Pools feature a lower and upper target that represent the desired range of values for the
    // main token balance. Any action that moves the main balance away from this range is charged a proportional fee,
    // and any action that moves it towards this range is incentivized by paying the actor using these collected fees.
    // The collected fees are not stored in a separate data structure: they are a function of the current main balance,
    // targets and fee percentage. The main balance sans fees is known as the 'nominal balance', which is always smaller
    // than the real balance except when the real balance is within the targets.
    // The rule under which Linear Pools conduct trades between main and wrapped tokens is by keeping the sum of nominal
    // main balance and wrapped balance constant: this value is known as the 'invariant'. BPT is backed by nominal
    // reserves, meaning its supply is proportional to the invariant. As the wrapped token appreciates in value and its
    // exchange rate to the main token increases, so does the invariant and thus the value of BPT (in main token units).
